## 📖 Project Description  

**HaarJeet** is a simple, beginner-friendly smart contract game deployed on the **Celo Sepolia Testnet**.  
It allows users to place a bet, choose between **0 or 1** (like heads or tails), and instantly see whether they win or lose — all handled transparently on the blockchain.  

This project is designed for learners who want to understand:  
- How decentralized betting logic works  
- How to deploy and interact with smart contracts  
- How events and payouts function in blockchain games

## 💡 What It Does  

1. Players place a bet using CELO directly on the blockchain.  
2. They select their choice: **0** or **1**.  
3. The contract generates a pseudo-random outcome (0 or 1).  
4. If the player’s choice matches the outcome — they **win 2x their bet** (minus a small house fee).  
5. If not — the contract retains the bet amount.  

Every result is stored on-chain, ensuring full transparency and verifiable fairness.
